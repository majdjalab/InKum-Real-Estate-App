## Technologies Used

1. React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It enables the development of native-like user interfaces for both iOS and Android platforms.

2. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that allows the creation of scalable and efficient web applications. It provides the backend API endpoints and handles data storage and retrieval.

4. Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the development of server-side logic and routing.

5. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores and retrieves the real estate listings, user information, and posts. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for data management.

6. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication and authorization. JWTs are generated upon successful login and are included in subsequent requests to authenticate and authorize users.
